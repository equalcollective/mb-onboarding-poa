## Document Purpose

Framework for analyzing and optimizing Amazon listings by tracking customer journey through the ICAP funnel stages. Provides methodology for identifying where customers drop off and strategies to widen the funnel at every level.

---

## 1. The ICAP Funnel Framework

### What is ICAP?

**ICAP** = **I**mpressions → **C**licks → **A**dd to Carts → **P**urchases

A sequential funnel tracking the customer journey from discovery to purchase.

```
Impressions (Visibility)
    ↓
Clicks (Interest)
    ↓
Add to Carts (Intent)
    ↓
Purchases (Conversion)
```

### Goal

Identify where consumers drop off and **widen the funnel at every level**.

## 2. Data Acquisition: Search Query Performance Report

### Primary Data Source

The **Search Query Performance Report** (SQP) in Amazon Brand Analytics.

**How to Access:**
1. Navigate to Brand Analytics
2. Select the brand
3. Choose timeframe (weekly or monthly)
4. View keyword performance across ICAP stages

### Analysis Logic

- Amazon ranks keywords by importance automatically
- "Mine" the report to identify keywords where your brand's performance deviates from market average
- Look for both underperformance (problems to fix) and overperformance (opportunities to scale)

---

## 3. The Primary Signal: Click Share vs Impression Share

### The Key Diagnostic

Compare your **Impression Share %** to your **Click Share %** for each keyword.

### Decision Rule

| Comparison | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Click Share > Impression Share | Product is MORE relevant than competitors for this term | Invest more - scale ads and optimize copy |
| Click Share < Impression Share | Product is LESS appealing than competitors when shown | Fix CTR issues - images, title, price |
| Click Share ≈ Impression Share | Performing at market average | Look at ATC and Purchase rates for opportunity |

### Example

**Keyword:** "sage candles for cleansing house"
- Impression Share: 2.75%
- Click Share: 7.5%

**Interpretation:** Product is 2.7x more relevant than impression share suggests. Despite not being a traditional candle, consumers find it compelling.

**Action Taken:** Increased ad spend, adjusted copy.

**Result:** Tripled impression share.

## 4. Diagnosing Funnel Bottlenecks

### Impression Problems (Low Visibility)

**Symptom:** Low impression share for relevant keywords

**Generic Causes:**
- Lack of indexing for the keyword
- Insufficient ad spend
- Poor organic ranking

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure **exact match keywords** are in:
   - Title (highest weight)
   - Bullet points
   - A+ content
   - Backend keywords
2. Increase ad spend on exact match campaigns
3. Verify product is indexed for the term

**Example:**
- Product: "Mega Pint" glass
- Problem: Not ranking for "Pirates of the Caribbean merchandise"
- Root Cause: Term "pirate" not in listing content
- Fix: Add "pirate" to A+ content to increase indexing

---

### Click-Through Rate (CTR) Problems

**Symptom:** Click Share lower than Impression Share

**Generic Causes:**
- Product doesn't look relevant in search results
- Main image doesn't communicate product clearly
- Title doesn't match search intent
- Price appears uncompetitive

**Solutions:**
1. Optimize **main photo** to match search intent
2. Ensure title has **exact match** for high-performing search query
3. Review pricing relative to competitors
4. Test different main images

**Example:**
- Keyword: "Johnny Depp merchandise"
- Problem: Click-through rate lower than impression share
- Root Cause: Product (joke tumbler) doesn't immediately show what consumer wants (perhaps expected actor's face)
- Fix: Consider image showing product in context or title adjustment

---

### Add to Cart (ATC) Problems

**Symptom:** Good CTR but low Add to Cart rate

**Generic Causes:**
- Page content doesn't convince customer to buy
- Unclear product details
- Lack of urgency
- Missing trust signals

**Solutions:**
1. Focus on **secondary images** - show product in use, detail shots
2. Create sense of urgency (limited availability, deals)
3. Strengthen bullet points with benefits
4. Add social proof (review highlights in images)

---

### Purchase Problems

**Symptom:** Good ATC rate but low Purchase rate

**Generic Causes:**
- "Buyer's remorse" at final stage
- Shipping costs surprise
- Competitor comparison at last moment
- Uncertainty about fit/quality

**Solutions:**
1. Reassure through social proof
2. Clearer product details (dimensions, materials)
3. Competitive pricing
4. Strong A+ content addressing objections

---

## 5. The "Inverted Funnel" Opportunity

### Concept

Sometimes a product has a "static" top funnel (Impressions ≈ Clicks) but percentages **increase** at ATC or Purchase stage.

```
Normal Funnel:        Inverted Funnel:
100% Impressions      100% Impressions
 ↓                     ↓
 5% Clicks             2% Clicks
 ↓                     ↓
 1% ATC                3% ATC ← Jumps UP
 ↓                     ↓
 0.5% Purchase         5% Purchase ← Jumps UP
```

### What It Means

- Product is **highly desirable once discovered**
- Top of funnel (visibility/CTR) is the constraint
- Massive opportunity to scale if you can fix the click rate

### Action

1. Identify keywords with inverted funnel pattern
2. Prioritize CTR improvements (main image, title) for these keywords
3. Increase ad spend once CTR improves
4. These are your highest-ROI optimization targets

**Example:**
- Product: "Mega Pint" glass
- Keyword: "Johnny Depp merchandise"
- Pattern: Initial click rate was low
- But: ATC rate jumped to 6.3%, Purchase rate to 10.7%
- Conclusion: Product is highly desirable once discovered
- Action: Invest in main image or title changes to improve initial click rate

## 6. Key Principles

### Never Tell Consumers How to Use Your Product

If data shows customers are buying your "smudge kit" when searching for "candles," **treat it as a candle in your marketing**.

- Let customer behavior guide positioning
- Don't fight the data
- Adapt copy and keywords to match how customers find you

### Continuous Monitoring

- SQP data changes weekly
- Monitor at least **once every two weeks**
- Adjust strategy based on trend changes
- Watch for new keyword opportunities and declining performers

### Scientific Scaling

When you identify keywords where:
1. Click Share > Impression Share, AND
2. Conversion depth (ICAP) is improving

**Action:** Spend significantly more on ads for those specific terms.

This is data-validated scaling, not guesswork.

## 7. ICAP Analysis Checklist

### For Each Priority Keyword:

- [ ] What is my Impression Share?
- [ ] What is my Click Share?
- [ ] Is Click Share > Impression Share? (signal to invest)
- [ ] What is my ATC rate vs market?
- [ ] What is my Purchase rate vs market?
- [ ] Where is the biggest drop-off in my funnel?
- [ ] Is there an inverted funnel opportunity?

### When You Find a Drop-Off:

| Stage | First Actions |
|-------|---------------|
| Impressions low | Check indexing, increase ad spend |
| CTR low | Optimize main image, title |
| ATC low | Improve secondary images, create urgency |
| Purchase low | Add social proof, clarify details |

---

## 8. Integration with Other Frameworks

### Connection to Multi-Layer CVR Analysis

ICAP provides the **granular keyword-level view** while CVR analysis provides the **account-level view**.

Use together:
1. CVR analysis identifies overall conversion issues
2. ICAP analysis pinpoints which keywords and which funnel stages need work

### Connection to Test Budget Calculation

When ICAP identifies high-opportunity keywords (Click Share > Impression Share with good conversion):
- Calculate required test budget for that keyword
- These keywords should get priority budget allocation
