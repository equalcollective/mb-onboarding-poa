## Document Purpose

Step-by-step methodology for analyzing Amazon seller accounts. Covers the analytical thought process from initial assessment through actionable recommendations, with emphasis on structured documentation and client communication.

---

## 1. Initial Account Assessment

### 1.1 Category & Competitive Landscape Analysis

**Process:**
1. Evaluate category competitiveness:
   - Total category size/search volume
   - Top competitor revenue numbers
   - Current brand performance vs category leaders
   - Gap analysis to identify opportunity size

**Interpretation:**
- Large gap between top performers and client → Either opportunity OR fundamental product/market fit issue
- Small gap → Incremental optimization focus
- Client outperforming → Defend and scale

**Key Question:** "What's the realistic ceiling for this product in this category?"

---

## 2. Conversion Rate Diagnostic Framework

### 2.1 Layered Conversion Analysis

Analyze CVR at multiple levels to pinpoint WHERE the problem exists:

| Level | What It Reveals |
|-------|-----------------|
| Overall Account CVR | Baseline performance |
| Ad-Level CVR | Paid traffic quality |
| Branded vs Non-Branded CVR | Brand strength vs product appeal |
| Campaign-Specific CVR | Individual targeting performance |

### 2.2 Diagnostic Decision Tree

```
If overall CVR strong but ad CVR weak:
  → Traffic quality issue (targeting, keywords)

If branded CVR strong but non-branded weak:
  → Product differentiation or listing issue

If all CVRs are low:
  → Fundamental product-market fit problem
```

**Key Insight:** Strong branded CVR + weak non-branded CVR = listing/positioning issue, NOT traffic quality issue

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Low Conversion

### 3.1 Review Analysis Process

**Steps:**
1. Check review count and average rating
2. Click on 1-star reviews specifically
3. Categorize complaints:

| Category | Example Issues |
|----------|---------------|
| Product Quality | Taste, effectiveness, authenticity |
| Packaging | Leaks, damage, presentation |
| Price/Value | "Too expensive for what you get" |
| Description Mismatch | Product differs from listing |
| Competitive Comparison | "X brand is better" |

4. Identify patterns: Are issues ongoing (recent reviews) or historical?
5. Classify: Fixable vs unfixable issues

**Key Principle:** 1-star reviews are the most actionable data source. They tell you exactly why customers reject your product.

### 3.2 Product Positioning Analysis

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What makes this product unique?
2. How does it compare to category expectations?
3. Does positioning match search intent?

**When Product Differs from Category Norms:**
- Option A: Find sub-niche that values your unique trait
- Option B: Educate customers why your difference is beneficial

---

## 4. Pricing Competitiveness Analysis

### 4.1 Per-Unit Normalization (CRITICAL)

**Process:**
1. Identify standard unit of measurement for category:
   - Dry powders → ounces (NOT fluid ounces)
   - Liquids → fluid ounces or ml
   - Consumables → count, servings
2. Convert ALL competitor pricing to same unit
3. Calculate your price per unit
4. Compare against competitive range

**Common Listing Mistake:** Wrong unit type (e.g., "fluid ounces" for powder) creates confusion and hides true pricing.

### 4.2 Price Positioning Map

Create standardized comparison:

| Product | Total Price | Size | Price/Unit | Position |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|----------|
| Your Product | $22 | 1.59 oz | $13.83/oz | Premium |
| Competitor A | $15 | 15 oz | $1.00/oz | Budget |
| Competitor B | $18 | 3 oz | $6.00/oz | Mid |

**Decision Point:** Is premium pricing justified by reviews, brand, and differentiation?

---

## 5. Search Term & Keyword Analysis

### 5.1 SQP Analysis Process

**Steps:**
1. Filter for keywords with minimum engagement (e.g., min 1 add-to-cart)
2. Separate branded vs non-branded terms
3. For branded keywords:
   - Is brand name being searched?
   - Are we capturing that traffic?
   - Low volume = low brand awareness
4. For non-branded terms:
   - What categories drive purchases?
   - Are customers finding us through expected keywords?

**Key Insight:** Where purchases come from reveals true product-market fit. Unexpected keyword sources may indicate you're solving a different problem than intended.

### 5.2 Campaign Type Audit

**Document for each campaign:**
- Campaign type (auto, manual broad/phrase/exact, product targeting)
- Primary keywords/targets
- Spend level
- Sales generated
- ACOS/ROAS

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is spend allocated to strategic priorities?
- Are high-converting products getting sufficient budget?
- Are auto campaigns appropriate for competitive categories?

---

## 6. Minimum Viable Test Size Calculation

### 6.1 Click Volume Framework

**Variables:**

| Product Price | Expected CVR Range | Clicks Needed |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| <$20 | 15-25% | 50-100 |
| $20-$60 | 8-15% | 100-200 |
| >$60 | 3-10% | 200-500 |

### 6.2 Test Budget Calculation

```
Minimum Test Budget = Desired Clicks × Expected CPC
Expected Orders = Desired Clicks × Expected CVR
Expected Revenue = Expected Orders × AOV
Maximum Loss = Test Budget - (Expected Revenue × Profit Margin)
```

**Example:**
- Target: 100 clicks
- CPC: $2.37
- Expected spend: $237
- Expected CVR: 10% → 10 orders
- Order value: $22 → Revenue: $220
- Expected loss: ~$17 (before COGS)

### 6.3 Decision Framework

```
If Maximum Loss is acceptable to client:
  → Proceed with test

If not:
  → Reduce CPC (manual campaigns, bid optimization)
  → OR improve CVR hypothesis first (listing optimization)
```

---

## 7. CTR vs CVR Optimization Priority

### 7.1 Decision Framework

**When CVR is the Primary Problem:**
- DON'T focus on CTR improvement first
- Logic: More clicks × low CVR = more wasted spend
- Priority: Fix conversion issues (reviews, listing, pricing, positioning)

**When to Focus on CTR:**
- CVR is acceptable (>10-15% for non-branded)
- Need more volume to scale
- Want to reduce CPC through improved relevance

### 7.2 Profitability Check

```
If (CVR × AOV × Margin) < CPC:
  → Fix CVR first

Else if CTR is low:
  → Optimize for more traffic
```

---

## 8. Seasonality & Trend Analysis

### 8.1 Monthly Search Volume Analysis

**Process:**
1. Export 12+ months of search volume data for primary keywords
2. Identify patterns:
   - Consistent year-round
   - Seasonal peaks
   - Growing/declining trends
3. Overlay with sales data to confirm correlation

**For Trend-Driven Products:**
- Expect volatility in search volume
- Pattern: Initial hype → dip → sustained interest from adopters
- Budget accordingly for seasonal windows
- Don't panic on short-term dips if they match seasonal patterns

### 8.2 Validation Method

Check if recent decline matches expected seasonal pattern or is anomalous:
- Compare current month to same month prior year
- Look at 3-month trend leading into current period

---

## 9. Listing Optimization Diagnosis

### 9.1 Critical Elements Checklist

| Element | Audit Questions |
|---------|-----------------|
| Title | Contains primary keywords? Benefit-focused? |
| Images | Professional? Show product in use? Address objections? |
| Bullet Points | Benefits over features? Address review concerns? |
| A+ Content | Brand story? Differentiation? Trust signals? |
| Description | Complete? Addresses FAQs? |

### 9.2 Conversion-Focused Audit

For products with conversion issues, check:
- Does listing address negative review themes?
- Does it justify premium pricing?
- Does it differentiate from competitors?
- Does it build trust/credibility?

---

## 10. Competitive Intelligence Process

### 10.1 Per-Competitor Analysis

For each top competitor, document:

**Revenue & Scale:**
- Estimated monthly revenue
- Review count and velocity
- Market position (leader, challenger, niche)

**Pricing:**
- Per-unit pricing (normalized)
- Bundle/quantity options
- Promotion frequency

**Reviews:**
- Average rating
- Common praise (your gaps)
- Common complaints (your opportunities)

**Positioning:**
- Emphasized keywords
- Unique claims
- Target customer segment

### 10.2 Strategic Response

```
If competing in same space:
  → Must match table stakes (reviews, price competitiveness)

If different positioning:
  → Must find and target sub-niche specifically
```

---

## 11. Multi-Product Portfolio Strategy

### 11.1 Product Performance Matrix

For each product, track:
- Purchases (last 30 days)
- Add-to-carts
- Primary search terms
- Branded vs non-branded split
- Unique differentiation
- Competitive intensity

### 11.2 Budget Allocation Framework

```
For each product, assess:
- Current profitability
- Market size/opportunity
- Competitive intensity
- Unique differentiation

Prioritize budget to:
1. Profitable unique products → Defend and scale
2. Large opportunity + fixable issues → Invest to fix
3. Small opportunity or unfixable issues → Maintain or sunset
```

**Strategic Question:** Should budget follow current performance (invest in what's working) OR strategic priority (fix what has biggest upside)?

---

## 12. Campaign Structure Recommendations

### 12.1 Auto vs Manual Decision

**Auto Campaigns - Best For:**
- Discovery phase
- New products
- Gathering keyword data
- Low-competition categories

**Auto Campaigns - Limitations:**
- Less control
- Potentially high CPC
- Broad matching

**Manual Campaigns - Best For:**
- Competitive categories
- Specific targeting
- CPC control
- Expensive products

**Recommended Structure for Competitive Categories:**
1. Small auto campaign for discovery
2. Move high-performers to manual exact match
3. Use manual to control spend and targeting precision

---

## 13. Client Communication

### 13.1 Communicating Test Costs

**Framework:**
1. Calculate expected cost:
   - X clicks needed
   - At $Y CPC
   - Expecting Z% conversion
   - Total cost: $A
   - Expected revenue: $B
   - Expected loss: $C

2. Present clearly:
   > "To properly test [hypothesis], we need [X clicks]. At current CPC, this costs approximately $[A]. We expect [Z] orders generating ~$[B] revenue. The testing investment is approximately $[C]. This gives us statistically significant data for the next decision."

3. Get explicit approval for test budget

**Key Principle:** Translate clicks and conversions into dollar terms. Some clients will approve tests; others won't have budget—knowing upfront prevents misaligned expectations.

---

## 14. Account Profitability Check

### 14.1 Quick Assessment

**Calculation:**
```
Ad Sales: $X
Ad Spend: $Y
ACOS: (Y/X) × 100

Revenue after COGS: X × (1 - COGS%)
Revenue after COGS and Fees: X × (1 - COGS% - 15%)
Profit: Revenue after COGS and Fees - Y

Profitable if Profit > 0
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Profitable → Room for testing and experimentation
- Unprofitable → Need quick wins, less room for tests
- Determines client patience level

---

## 15. Documentation Best Practices

### 15.1 Problem-Analysis-Action Format

Structure findings in three columns:

| Problem Identified | Analysis/Evidence | Proposed Action |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Low non-branded CVR (6%) | Review issues, price positioning | Fix reviews, improve A+ content |
| High CPC ($2.37) | Auto campaigns in competitive category | Test manual campaigns |

**Benefits:**
- Easy to explain thought process in meetings
- Clear connection between problem → analysis → solution
- Reference for future discussions
- Helps team members learn analytical framework

---

## 16. Tool Usage & Data Sources

### 16.1 Primary Data Sources

| Tool | Use For | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| SQP | Keyword discovery, conversion analysis, trends | Export monthly for trend analysis |
| Business Reports | Sales trends, organic vs ad split | Previous day data unreliable, wait 2 days |
| AI Review Tools | Competitive feature analysis | Input competitor ASINs |

### 16.2 Common Data Issues

- **Negative organic sales:** Returns/refunds; look at longer periods
- **Weekly data gaps:** Use monthly views when needed
- **Dual-axis graphs:** Don't compare absolute brand vs industry numbers; compare TRENDS

---

## 17. Brand vs Industry Comparison

### 17.1 Proper Graph Interpretation

**Warning:** Many graphs have TWO y-axes (left and right)
- Brand metrics on one axis
- Industry metrics on another
- DON'T compare absolute numbers between them
- DO compare trend direction (up/down)

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are both trending same direction?
- Is your trend more/less severe than industry?
- What explains any divergence?

---

## 18. Core Analytical Principles Summary

1. **Start with conversion, not traffic** - Fix CVR before scaling clicks
2. **Layer your metrics** - Overall → Ad-level → Branded/Non-branded → Campaign-specific
3. **Normalize pricing** - Always compare per standard unit
4. **Read 1-star reviews** - They tell you exactly why you're losing sales
5. **Calculate test costs** - Know investment required before starting
