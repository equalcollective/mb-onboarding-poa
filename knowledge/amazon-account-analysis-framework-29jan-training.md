## Document Purpose

Systematic framework for analyzing Amazon seller accounts. Covers the complete analysis workflow from initial assessment through strategy development, with specific methodologies for conversion analysis, review audits, competitive research, and budget planning.

---

## 1. Initial Account Assessment Approach

### 1.1 Starting Point: Understanding Client Focus

**Before diving into data, identify:**
- All product categories/SKUs
- Which products are priorities vs. experimental
- Unique selling propositions for each category
- Product relationships (bundles, variants, etc.)

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents wasted analysis time on low-priority products
- Ensures optimization efforts align with business goals
- Helps identify where to focus limited budget

---

## 2. Conversion Rate Analysis Framework

### 2.1 Multi-Layer Conversion Analysis

**Analyze conversion rates at multiple levels to identify bottlenecks:**

| Level | What It Shows |
|-------|---------------|
| Overall Account CVR | Baseline performance |
| Ad-Level CVR | Performance when ads drive traffic |
| Branded vs Non-Branded CVR | Brand strength vs. category competitiveness |
| Campaign-Specific CVR | Performance by product/category |

**Key Diagnostic:**
If branded CVR is acceptable but non-branded CVR is poor → listing/positioning issue, not traffic quality

### 2.2 Diagnostic Questions When Conversion Gaps Exist

1. **Traffic quality issue?** (wrong keywords)
2. **Listing issue?** (reviews, images, copy, pricing)
3. **Product-market fit issue?** (product doesn't match search intent)
4. **Competitive positioning issue?** (outcompeted on features/price/reviews)

---

## 3. Review Analysis Methodology

### 3.1 Systematic Review Audit

**Review Components to Analyze:**

| Component | Threshold | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Overall Rating | 4.0+ minimum | Below 4.0 severely hurts conversion in competitive categories |
| Review Count | 100+ | Low count (<100) impacts trust |
| 1-2 Star Patterns | Look for themes | Reveals ongoing issues |
| Recent vs Old | Check dates | Are issues resolved or ongoing? |

### 3.2 Negative Review Pattern Categories

Filter by 1-star and 2-star reviews, look for:
- **Product quality issues** (taste, effectiveness, authenticity)
- **Packaging/shipping issues** (damage, leaks)
- **Pricing complaints** (value perception)
- **Misleading descriptions** (expectations vs. reality)

### 3.3 Review-Driven Action Items

Based on review analysis, determine:
- **Immediate fixes needed** (e.g., packaging issues)
- **Product positioning adjustments** (if complaints reveal wrong market positioning)
- **Whether reviews can be improved** or if a new listing is needed

---

## 4. Competitive Analysis Framework

### 4.1 Pricing Analysis - Unit Economics Comparison

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Always compare pricing on a per-unit basis, not total price.

**Methodology:**
1. Identify correct unit of measurement for category:
   - Dry powders: ounces (NOT fluid ounces)
   - Liquids: fluid ounces or milliliters
   - Other: appropriate unit for category
2. Calculate: `Price ÷ Unit Quantity = Price per Unit`
3. Compare across competitors
4. Identify pricing tier (budget, mid-range, premium)

**Common Red Flag:** Incorrect units on listing (e.g., "fluid ounces" for powder) creates confusion and hurts comparisons

### 4.2 Competitive Revenue Analysis

**Assess using available tools:**
- Competitor monthly revenue (identifies market leaders)
- Number of reviews (proxy for longevity and sales volume)
- Review velocity (recent review growth)
- Sponsored ad presence (ad spend commitment)

**What Large Gaps Indicate:**
- Top competitors at $8K-$20K/month vs. client at low hundreds
- Indicates opportunity OR fundamental mismatch (positioning, pricing, reviews)

---

## 5. Keyword & Search Query Analysis

### 5.1 Search Term Performance Analysis (SQP Tool)

**Analyze search queries across multiple dimensions:**

**Dimension 1: Branded vs Non-Branded Performance**
- Filter by branded terms vs category terms
- Compare conversion rates, add-to-cart rates
- Identify if brand awareness exists

**Dimension 2: Add-to-Cart Analysis**
- Filter for queries with minimum 1 add-to-cart
- Shows purchase intent keywords
- Lower threshold than purchases (more data points)

**Dimension 3: Product-Specific vs Category Keywords**
- Specific: "ceremonial matcha," "matcha powder"
- Broad: "green tea," "tea"
- Understand which level converts

### 5.2 Search Volume & Seasonality Analysis

**Before investing heavily, understand:**
1. Is this category seasonal?
2. Is search volume trending up, down, or stable?
3. What is the monthly search volume range?

**Method:**
- Use SQP monthly search volume data
- Look at year-over-year trends
- Check for seasonal patterns (Dec-Jan vs. rest of year)

---

## 6. Campaign Structure Analysis

### 6.1 Evaluating Existing Campaign Setup

**Assess current campaign structure:**

**Campaign Types to Review:**
- Auto campaigns (broad discovery)
- Manual campaigns (targeted)
- Product-specific campaigns
- Category campaigns

**Performance Metrics:**
- Week-over-week spend and sales trends
- CPC trends (increasing = more competition or poor optimization)
- Conversion rate by campaign
- ACOS by campaign

### 6.2 When to Use Auto vs Manual Campaigns

**Auto Campaigns - Best for:**
- Product discovery phase
- Low-competition niches
- Products with unique features (less competition)

**Manual Campaigns - Required when:**
- Market is highly competitive
- CPC is high (need precision targeting)
- Product is expensive (can't afford broad traffic)
- Need to control exact keyword targeting

**Rule:** Expensive products in competitive categories should NOT rely on auto campaigns

---

## 7. Budget Planning & Click Volume Requirements

### 7.1 Determining Required Click Volume for Testing

**CRITICAL FRAMEWORK:**

Before judging conversion performance, you need a statistically meaningful sample of LEGITIMATE clicks.

**Click Volume by Price Point:**

| Product Price | Expected CVR | Clicks Needed |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| <$15 | Higher CVR% | 50-100 clicks |
| $15-$50 | Moderate CVR% | 100-200 clicks |
| $50-$80 | Lower CVR% | 200-300 clicks |
| >$80 | Low CVR% | 300-500 clicks |

**Test Budget Calculation:**
```
Test Budget = Required Clicks × Average CPC
Expected Orders = Test Budget ÷ Expected CVR ÷ Product Price

If (Expected Orders × Product Price) < Test Budget → You'll lose money during testing
```

**Define "Legitimate Clicks":**
- From relevant, high-intent keywords only
- NOT from broad, informational queries
- NOT from irrelevant traffic

### 7.2 Client Budget Capacity Assessment

**Before planning tests, understand:**
1. What is client's monthly ad budget?
2. What ACOS target are they comfortable with?
3. What loss are they willing to absorb during testing?
4. What is their COGS? (determines minimum viable ACOS)

---

## 8. Product Positioning Strategy

### 8.1 Identifying Positioning Problems

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Is the product competing in the right subcategory?
2. Does the product's USP match what customers search for?
3. Is there a better niche/sub-niche to target?

**Signs of Positioning Problems:**
- Premium-priced but lacking premium justification (reviews, features)
- Competing against better-established alternatives
- Product attributes don't match category expectations

### 8.2 Sub-Niche Strategy for Premium Products

**When product is premium-priced in competitive category:**

1. **Don't compete broadly** - You'll lose to cheaper alternatives
2. **Find your sub-niche** - Specific attributes that justify premium
3. **Target that sub-niche explicitly** - In keywords, ad copy, listing

**Example:**
- Instead of: "matcha powder" (too broad, price-sensitive)
- Target: "Korean matcha," "Jeju matcha," "organic Korean matcha"
- Build campaigns around specific positioning

---

## 9. Listing Optimization Priorities

### 9.1 Critical Listing Issues Checklist

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Incorrect units of measurement | Impacts price comparison | High |
| Low review count (<100) | Trust issue in competitive categories | High |
| Low review rating (<4.0) | Direct conversion killer | Critical |
| Recent negative reviews | Indicates ongoing issues | High |
| Missing brand story | No trust-building elements | Medium |
| Weak images | Poor visual presentation | High |
| Value proposition mismatch | Premium price without justification | Critical |

---

## 10. Data-Driven Decision Making Process

### 10.1 The Funnel Analysis Approach

**Work backwards through the funnel to identify bottlenecks:**

```
1. Start with: Conversion Rate (final step)
2. Then examine: Click-Through Rate (middle step)
3. Finally assess: Impressions (top of funnel)
```

**Critical Logic:**
- If CVR is low, fixing CTR (getting more clicks) will only INCREASE losses
- Fix conversion FIRST, then work on getting more traffic
- Exception: If you don't have enough data, you may need more clicks first (but only LEGITIMATE clicks)

**Common Mistake:**
Suggestion: "Increase CTR to get more data"
Problem: "If you increase CTR and conversion doesn't improve, losses increase"
Correct approach: Fix conversion issues (listing, reviews, positioning) FIRST

---

## 11. Seasonality & Trend Analysis

### 11.1 Understanding Market Trends

**Before making major strategy changes, understand if performance changes are:**

1. **Your account-specific** (something you did/didn't do)
2. **Market-wide** (seasonal downturn, trend change)
3. **Competitor-driven** (new entrant, aggressive competitor)

**Method:**
- Compare your brand performance vs. industry benchmarks (SQP)
- Check if competitors are also seeing same trends
- Look at search volume trends
- Check if organic sales also declined (not just ad sales)

**Key Diagnostic:** If organic sales also dropped → market-wide issue, not just ad issue

---

## 12. When to Consider Major Changes

### 12.1 New Listing vs. Fix Existing

**Consider NEW Listing When:**
- Review rating is <3.5 and difficult to recover
- Review count is low (<100) AND rating is poor
- Product has fundamental issue that can't be fixed
- Listing has "baggage" that hurts performance

**Fix EXISTING Listing When:**
- Review count is decent (>100)
- Issues are fixable (packaging, description, images)
- Rating is >3.5
- Cost of new listing launch is prohibitive

**Review Recovery Math:**
- Current: 159 reviews at 3.X rating
- Adding 15 positive reviews could push rating to 4.0+
- Method: Vine program, early reviewer program, etc.
