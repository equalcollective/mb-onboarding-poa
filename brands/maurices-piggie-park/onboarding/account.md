## 2. Report Analysis Summary

### Business Report Insights
> Link to full analysis: [Business Report](./reports/business-report.md)

**Key Findings (Last 8 weeks):**
- Original (1, 2, 3-pack): ~$2,500 each - top sellers
- Variety Set: ~$1,000 (4th highest)
- Other flavors (Spicy, Hickory Red, etc.): <$300 each
- YoY: All products up except Variety Set (slight decline, within acceptable range)
- Original dominates because it's the signature/famous flavor

### SQP Analysis Insights
> Link to full analysis: [SQP Analysis](./reports/sqp-analysis.md)

**Key Findings:**
- **Impression share:** 0.15% → 0.55% since ads started (~3.5-4x growth), still room for 4x more
- **CTR:** At par with industry, but dipped significantly Jan 4 & Jan 18 weeks - needs investigation
- **Conversion:** Low overall - Buy Box fix (FBA winning) is the low-hanging fruit

**Market/Keyword Insights:**
- Competing in niche: Carolina mustard BBQ, South Carolina mustard BBQ, mustard BBQ, southern gold BBQ
- NOT fighting for generic "barbecue sauce" - fighting in regional specialty space
- Bessinger's identified as competitor (seeing some conversions there)
- "Southern gold barbecue" is a related search category to explore

**Branded Search:**
- "Maurice's" and "Piggie Park" both have good search volume
- Strong cart add + purchase rate on branded terms = good brand recall
- Note: Another non-BBQ "Maurice's" brand causes some impression overlap
- Implication: Customer acquisition → retention potential is high

## 3. Opportunities Identified

### Quick Wins (0-2 weeks)
1. **Fix Buy Box issue** - FBM winning Buy Box over FBA across almost all ASINs despite similar total price. Need to investigate and resolve (pricing adjustment or FBM deactivation?)
2. **Merge Hickory Red to Parent** - B00MRB9QP0 (Hickory Red BBQ Sauce) is not merged with Parent ASIN B0B6MFCXJ8
3. Review FBA vs FBM pricing strategy account-wide

### Medium-term (2-8 weeks)
1. **Test auto campaigns on other flavors** - Spicy, Hickory Red, etc. have zero ad spend; run auto campaigns to gauge demand
2. **Evaluate Variety Set positioning** - Consider merging to parent ASIN to improve discoverability as gateway product
3. **Determine priority product focus** - After testing, decide whether to double down on Original or diversify

### Long-term / Strategic
1. Identify growth ceiling for Original flavor
2. Build out secondary flavor(s) if testing shows promise
3. Seasonal strategy (BBQ season push)
