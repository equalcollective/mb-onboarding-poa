## Price Per Ounce Comparison

| Product | ASIN | Size | Est. Price | Price/oz | Rating | Reviews | Badge |
|---------|------|------|------------|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Maurice's Original 2-Pack** | B07P15CB6X | 36oz | ~$22 | **$0.61/oz** | 4.7⭐ | 989 | Amazon's Choice |
| Lillie's Q Gold | B01DOIMC1E | 20oz | ~$9 | ~$0.45/oz | 4.5⭐ | 808 | - |
| Cattlemen's Carolina Tangy Gold | B004YVWO9Q | 18oz | ~$3.50 | ~$0.19/oz | 4.7⭐ | 1,642 | Amazon's Choice |

### Price/oz Analysis

**Maurice's is priced at a PREMIUM:**
- **3.2x more expensive** than Cattlemen's (budget/mass-market)
- **1.4x more expensive** than Lillie's Q (premium artisan)

**Justification for premium:**
1. Regional specialty (authentic SC mustard BBQ from famous restaurant chain)
2. "Gourmet" positioning with heritage recipe
3. Restaurant brand recognition (Piggie Park)
4. No HFCS, no preservatives, all-natural ingredients

**Risk:** Price-sensitive shoppers may choose Cattlemen's (same Amazon's Choice badge, 65% more reviews, 1/3 the price)

### Advertising Performance (Declining ROAS - Concern)

|------|----------|----------|------|------|
| Dec 7 | $20.17 | $98.43 | **4.88** | 20.5% |
| Dec 14 | $13.96 | $37.88 | 2.71 | 36.9% |

**ROAS dropped from 4.88 to 0.77-1.50** - needs investigation. Possible causes:
