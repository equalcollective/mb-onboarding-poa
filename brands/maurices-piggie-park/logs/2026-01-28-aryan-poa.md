## Summary

Initial onboarding completed for Maurice's Piggie Park - a South Carolina regional BBQ sauce brand known for their signature mustard-based sauce. Identified key operational issues (Buy Box, listing structure) and strategic opportunities (flavor testing, impression share growth). Client has restaurant chain backing with strong inventory capacity and is open to growth once ROI is proven.

## Details

### Brand Overview
- **Product:** South Carolina mustard-based BBQ sauces (multiple flavors)
- **Differentiator:** Regional specialty - not competing for generic "BBQ sauce"
- **Target Market:** BBQ enthusiasts seeking authentic SC/Carolina mustard BBQ
- **Client Backing:** Established restaurant chain = credibility + inventory capacity

### Report Analysis Findings

**Business Report (8 weeks):**
| Product | Revenue | Ads? | YoY |
|---------|---------|------|-----|
| Original 1-pack | ~$2,500 | Yes | Up |
| Original 2-pack | ~$2,500 | Yes | Up |
| Original 3-pack | ~$2,500 | Yes | Up |
| Variety Set | ~$1,000 | Yes | Slight decline |
| Other flavors | <$300 each | No | Up |

**SQP Analysis:**
- Impression share: 0.15% → 0.55% (~4x growth since ads started)
- Room for another 4x growth in impression share
- CTR at par with industry, but dipped Jan 4 & Jan 18 weeks
- Conversion low overall
- Strong branded search recall ("Maurice's", "Piggie Park")

**Ad Report:**
- Only running ads on Original (1, 2, 3-pack)
- ROAS healthy across all
- No ads on other flavors = untapped opportunity

**Market/Keyword Insights:**
- Key terms: Carolina mustard BBQ, SC mustard BBQ, southern gold BBQ
- Competitor: Bessinger's
- Non-BBQ "Maurice's" brand causes some impression overlap

### Operational Issues Identified

1. **Buy Box (HIGH):** FBM winning over FBA across almost all ASINs despite similar total price
2. **Listing Structure:** Hickory Red (B00MRB9QP0) not merged with Parent (B0B6MFCXJ8)
3. **CTR Dip:** Significant drop Jan 4 & Jan 18 weeks - cause unknown

## Actions Taken

- Completed access verification (Seller Central, Ads Console, Brand Registry, A+, Brand Analytics)
- Received COGS data, design assets, brand guidelines from client
- Organized client Drive folder
- Completed Business Report, Ad Report, and SQP analysis
- Documented operational issues and opportunities

## Observations

- Original flavor dominates because it's the signature/famous one - brand recognition
- Variety set decline is within acceptable range
- Strong brand recall suggests good retention potential once customers are acquired
- Inventory will not be a constraint - client has capacity to scale
- Client wants to see ROI before aggressive spend

## Next Steps

### Quick Wins (0-2 weeks)
1. Fix Buy Box issue - get FBA to win over FBM (pricing adjustment or FBM deactivation)
2. Merge Hickory Red (B00MRB9QP0) to Parent ASIN (B0B6MFCXJ8)
3. Review FBA vs FBM pricing strategy account-wide

### Medium-term (2-8 weeks)
1. Test auto campaigns on other flavors (Spicy, Hickory Red, etc.)
2. Evaluate Variety Set positioning - consider merging to parent
3. Investigate CTR dip (Jan 4 & Jan 18 weeks)
4. Determine priority product focus based on test results

### Long-term / Strategic
1. Identify growth ceiling for Original flavor
2. Build out secondary flavor(s) if testing shows promise
3. Develop seasonal strategy (BBQ season: Memorial Day → Labor Day)

## Questions / Blockers

- Start date needs to be confirmed with client
- Success metrics not yet agreed upon
- Communication cadence not yet established
- Need to investigate cause of CTR dip
