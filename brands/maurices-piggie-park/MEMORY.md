## Patterns & Learnings

Things we've learned about this brand that should inform future decisions:

- **Product niche:** South Carolina mustard-based BBQ sauce - regional specialty, not mainstream
- **Client backing:** Established restaurant chain = credibility, inventory capacity, and resources
- **Growth mindset:** Open to growth but need to prove ROI first before aggressive investment
- **Inventory advantage:** Supply/capacity is NOT a constraint - can scale if demand is there

## Flags & Concerns

Items that need attention or have been escalated:

- **Buy Box issue (HIGH):** FBM winning over FBA across almost all ASINs - needs immediate fix
- **CTR dip (INVESTIGATE):** Significant drop Jan 4 & Jan 18 weeks - cause unknown
- **Listing structure:** Hickory Red (B00MRB9QP0) not merged with Parent (B0B6MFCXJ8)
- **Conversion low:** Overall conversion needs improvement; FBA Buy Box win is first step
- Start date needs to be confirmed
- Carolina Gold brand exists in account but is OUT OF SCOPE
- Non-BBQ "Maurice's" brand causes some impression overlap on branded search
