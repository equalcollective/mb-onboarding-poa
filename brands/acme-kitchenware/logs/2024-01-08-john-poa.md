## Summary

Initial strategic plan of action following onboarding analysis. Focus on optimizing top 3 products while maintaining account health.

## Details

### Strategic Context

After completing the onboarding analysis, we've identified clear opportunities:

1. **Advertising efficiency** - Current ACOS at 32%, target is 25%
2. **Listing optimization** - A+ Content needs refresh on 2 of 3 priority products
3. **Keyword gaps** - SQP analysis revealed 15+ high-volume keywords we're not targeting
4. **Competitor positioning** - Priced slightly above competitors but listings don't justify premium

### Goals (Q1 2024)

| Goal | Metric | Target | Current |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| Revenue Growth | Monthly Revenue | +15% | Baseline |
