## Summary

Completed campaign restructure and A+ Content submission. Early signs of improved ACOS. Inventory concern on cutting board.

## Details

### Advertising Updates

**Campaign Restructure (Completed)**
- Separated brand and non-brand campaigns as planned
- Created new structure:
  - `Acme_Brand_Exact` - brand terms only
  - `Acme_NonBrand_Auto` - discovery
  - `Acme_NonBrand_Exact` - proven converters
  - `Acme_NonBrand_Broad` - keyword expansion

**Bid Adjustments**
- Reduced bids 15% on underperforming placements (top of search was burning budget)
- Increased bids 10% on product page placements (better ROAS)

**Results (Early)**
- ACOS down from 32% to 28% (7-day view)
- Impressions stable despite bid reduction
- Will confirm trend next week
